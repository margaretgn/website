I am an Assistant Professor at the [School of Economics](https://www.ucd.ie/economics/), [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/) and a Research Fellow at the [Geary Institute for Public Policy](https://www.ucd.ie/geary/). I hold a PhD in Economics from [Lund University](https://nek.lu.se/en).

My research is primarily in behavioural economics, where I use theoretical, empirical and experimental methods to study individual decision-making. In particular, I focus on the effects of self-image, social image, emotions and self-control. More recently, I am also interested in studying how information shapes political preferences.

I am a member of the [Behavioural Science & Policy Group](https://bsp.ucd.ie/) and an affiliated researcher at the [Connected_Politics Lab](https://www.ucd.ie/connected_politics/) at UCD.
